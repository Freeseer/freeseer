How to Report a Bug or Make a Feature Request
=============================================

Freeseer is an open source project built by volunteers, who troubleshoot and
discuss features in public community spaces. If you've found a bug or have an
idea for Freeseer, here's what you can do to get help or feedback.


Step 1: Search
--------------

To avoid duplicate work, search our :doc:`documentation </index>`,
:ref:`mailing list <mailing-list-label>`, and `issue tracker
<https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues>`_ to make sure your problem or
idea hasn't already been documented or discussed. If it has, follow up on the
existing mailing list thread or issue tracker comment thread to discuss further.

If your problem or idea hasn't been addressed before, continue to Step 2.


Step 2: Don't File An Issue... Yet
----------------------------------

`Freeseer's issue tracker <https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues>`_ is
public, but try not to file a new issue unless the problem or feature
request has been discussed with the Freeseer community.
If you file a new issue without discussing, you risk it being closed for reasons
such as it being a known issue, or previously rejected idea, or off-topic.


Step 3: Contact the Community
-----------------------------

Send an email to our :ref:`mailing list <mailing-list-label>` describing your
problem or idea. You may also use our :ref:`IRC channel <irc-label>`
if you think it's a minor issue, but mailing list is preferred.
Please be specific when communicating.

For bug reports, describe step by step exactly what you did and what went wrong,
including application messaging word for word, as well as what version of
Freeseer you are running and what operating system and version of Python you are
running.

For feature ideas, describe exactly how you think the new functionality should
work, and include mockups and screenshots if you can. Sell your idea to the
community by clearly explaining its benefits and use cases, and how you plan to 
help make the feature.

Thanks for helping us make Freeseer a great application,
and for respecting the community's time and public spaces!

Step 4: File a New Issue using a Template
