==========

The Freeseer community is available to brainstorm, ask and answer questions, and offer support online.


Mailing Lists
-------------

The community's main hub of communication is our email list. Join our discussions on the 
`Freeseer Mailing List <http://box674.bluehost.com/mailman/listinfo/freeseer_fosslc.org>`_.


IRC Channel
-----------

Chat live with Freeseer community members in our IRC channel. Here are the connection details: 

* IRC Server: irc.freenode.net
* Channel/Room: #freeseer

You can `join via your browser <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#freeseer>`_ or your favourite IRC client.

If you enjoy working from the terminal, you can use `irssi <http://irssi.org/>`_.
To quickly get started:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install irssi
    $ irssi
    > /connect irc.freenode.net
    > /nick my-preferred-nickname (optional)
    > /join #freeseer

.. tip::

    Shortcuts exists, such as `/j` instead of `/join`.
    To block activity messages in the room: `/ignore -channels #freeseer * JOINS
    PARTS QUITS NICKS`. You can specificy more rooms by comma separating them.

Twitter, Facebook, and Blog
---------------------------

You can also find Freeseer community members on various channels across the web:

* On Twitter, follow `@fosslc <http://twitter.com/fosslc>`_
* Like `FOSSLC's Facebook Page <https://www.facebook.com/FreeAndOpenSourceSoftwareLearningCentre>`_
* Read and comment on `FOSSLC's blog <http://www.fosslc.org/drupal/category/community/freeseer>`_

.. seealso::

    The FOSSLC blog doesn't contain *all* Freeseer blog posts.
    Part of the Freeseer community prefers to blog about Freeseer on their
    personal blogs.

Toll-free Phone Number
----------------------

Call for free at **1-877-253-0617 x27**.
If Andrew (our project leader) isn't available to answer the call, then you'll be asked to leave a voicemail message.

We're thinking of setting up a system that forwards these voicemails to our mailing list. Stay tuned! 


G+ Hangouts
-----------

We're considering using Google+ Hangouts to host public Freeseer meetups.
Being able to see and hear others is good for community bonding.
Let us know if you support this idea!
