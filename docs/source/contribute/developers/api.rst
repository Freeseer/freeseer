Developing new APIs
===================

Freeseer uses a REST API framework to remotely control a headless Freeseer 
host. This article will give a primer on how APIs are designed, and how they 
are implemented with `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_.

RESTful API Primer
------------------

Freeseer's API strives to be RESTful, so you should learn the basics of REST 
theory to ensure that your endpoint is in fact RESTful. What follows is by no 
means a replacement for figuring out how RESTful APIs and endpoints are 
designed, but it is useful for understanding some of the design choices for our 
framework.

A REST API is a resource based interface for interacting with software. The 
most common use case for a REST API, is to allow us to interact with software 
across a network, without requiring any knowledge of the software's internals. 
Any parts of your software you wish to control externally are abstracted into 
resources and signified by URIs called endpoints. So in other words to design 
and develop a RESTful API is to design and develop endpoints that will allow 
us to interact with parts of your software from the outside. If some set of 
endpoints is logically related, they are grouped into a set called an API 
(For example, the Recording API, or the Configuration API).

So, to keep the somewhat vague terminology straight: generally when people talk 
about a “RESTful API”, they are referring to the entire RESTful API and also 
perhaps the framework on which the endpoints and APIs are built, but when they 
refer to “an API”, “the <insert group name here> API”, or some variation, they 
are referring to some specific API or set of APIs.

Designing Endpoints
-------------------

In the most simplistic and crude sense, a RESTful endpoint will be the plural 
of the type of resource that you want perform a ``GET``, ``POST``, ``DELETE``, 
or ``PATCH`` on. For example if you want to have RESTful endpoint for handling 
a server's users, you could have an endpoint named:

 ``/users``

You could either get a list of all users with

 ``GET /users``

Or post a new user with

 ``POST /users``

Or if you want to get specific instances of that resource, you use some 
identifier.

 ``GET /users/1`` - to get user with id “1”

 ``DELETE /users/1`` - to delete user with id “1”

You also want to have some parameters for your endpoint. For example for 
creating a user, you will want some set of parameters like, username, email, 
etc.

**From Endpoints to an API**

In the Freeseer RESTful API there is a logical organization to our endpoints, 
which we refer to as APIs. For example, one set of RESTful endpoints is grouped 
under the Recording API, where each resource is related to creating, deleting, 
accessing, or performing an action on some recording. Very rarely is an endpoint 
designed in isolation, we consider what API needs to be developed first and then 
think of what endpoints would fall under that API. So make sure that your 
endpoint either falls under and existing API or create a new API for that 
endpoint to fall under.

Developing an API
-----------------

**Note:** From this point forward we assume that you are creating a new API 
(a new logically grouped set of RESTful API endpoints). If you simply need to 
add new endpoint to an existing API, you can skip ahead to *Developing Endpoints*

**Creating an API module**

In the ``freeseer/frontend/controller/`` folder, create a new module 
<api_name>.py (replacing <api_name> with the name of your api. You will need to
import the ``Blueprint`` and ``request`` modules from flask with:

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Blueprint
    from flask import request

You will also need to import the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from freeseer.frontend.controller import app

``app`` is the server's ``Flask`` app.

**Using Blueprints**

To organize our endpoints into separate APIs, we make use of Flask's 
``Blueprint`` module. All of our endpoints and API specific code and data will 
exist in an instance of the ``Blueprint`` module, which simply extends the 
existing Flask server app. 

To instantiate our API, we add the following code to our API module.

.. code-block:: python

    <api_name> = Blueprint('<api_name>', __name__) 

Then we need to associate our Blueprint with the Flask app, to do this we add 
code to ``freeseer/frontend/controller/__init__.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    from freeseer.frontend.controller.<api_name> import <api_name>

    app.register(<api_name>)

**API-specific Functions and Data**

Outside of the endpoints, there are a number of functions an API may need to 
function properly. For example, the ``recording`` api needs to instantiate the 
multimedia backend for any of its endpoints to work. The ``Blueprint`` can 
provide us with a number of decorators to wrap any functions that would be 
necessary for the functioning of our api. Furthermore, any api specific data can 
be saved to the ``Blueprint`` object.

One of the most useful for developers will be the 
``@<name_of_api>.before_first_request`` decorator. Any code that needs to be run 
so that the endpoints can function should be decorated by this decorator so it 
can run before the first request is made to the REST framework. For example, in 
the recording api, we have a function called ``configure_recording()`` that 
loads references to existing videos from disk so our endpoints will work. By 
wrapping it with ``@recording.before_app_first_request``, that code will fire 
when the first call to the REST API is made. 


Developing Endpoints
--------------------

**Route decorator**

Every endpoint is wrapped with a ``@<name_of_api>.route()`` decorator. 

 **Decorator Parameters**

 :rule: the first parameter of the ``route()`` function. The path of the 
 endpoint with any path parameters declared. Ex. route('/users') will establish 
 a route at to http://<host_info>/users

 :methods: a list of all methods (GET, POST, etc.) this route accepts. Example:
 ``route('users/<int:id>', methods=['GET'])`` means this function will only fire 
 if a GET request is sent to the corresponding path.

More information about route registration can be found in the `Flask 
documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#url-route-registration>`_

**Path parameters**

Any path parameters are specified with angular brackets. Ex. 
``route('/users/<username>')`` means any text entered after ``/users/`` will be
saved as a string under the variable ``username``.

If you want your parameter to be coerced to a certain type, you use the format 
<type:name>

Available types include int, and float.

**Request Body**

In Flask, for an endpoint to accept a parameters from a request body, we don't 
need to explicitly declare body parameters in our function definition or route 
decorator. A function can examine the body of data sent by some client by 
reading the data found in 'request.form' where our body would be contained.


**Request validation**

Obviously we want some way to ensure our endpoint gets the right kind of data 
(in our case, ``JSON`` formatted), and gets the data the endpoint expects. So we 
have added a module called ``validate`` that ensures the body data is the 
correct format, and contains the data the endpoint needs to function. 

The validate module validates request data through 
``validate_form(to_validate, schema)``

 **Function Parameters:**

 :to_validate: the body data of our request. In most cases this will be 
 'request.form'.
 :schema: a `jsonschema <http://json-schema.org>`_ formatted schema to describe 
 what our request data should look like.   

If the validation fails, ``validate_form()`` throws an ``HTTPError`` which will
be sent to the client as a response.

**Validation Schemas**

Depending on the nature of your API, your validation schema may be 
automatically generated. 

.. todo:: Fill in information about how validation schemas are automatically 
generated

If your schema is not auto-generated, you may have to include any relevant 
schemas in the Blueprint object. (In the case of Recording API, we store the 
schemas in a dictionary called form_schema.)

We use the library jsonschema to validate our json objects. The json-schema 
`documentation <http://json-schema.org>`_ will have any information you need for 
creating json schemas to validate data against.

**Returning a response**

For your function to return information back to the client, the endpoint 
function needs to return a ``dict`` which represents the JSON object that will 
be the body of the response returned by the server.  

By wrapping our endpoint function with ``@http_response(status_code)`` 
(status_code being the HTTP status code that indicates success), the ``dict`` 
and ``status_code`` become the basis for our response to the client. The 
decorator should go between the route decorator and the endpoint function.

**Error handling**

Our endpoints needs some way of handling requests that would cause our endpoint
functions to fail, and alert the client that their request was faulty. We do 
this by catching the error as it happens, or pre-empting it via some validation,
and sending a response back to the client that includes error information for 
why the request failed. For example, an endpoint receiving a request for a 
non-existent resources like a non-existing user.

When we do run into one of these errors, we need to send a response with an 
appropriate status code, and error information in our responses body. In the 
case of a non-existent recording, we alert the user with a 404 status code, and
our response body will be a JSON object that includes a useful message such as 
'No recording with id <id> was found.'

**HTTPError**

If we encounter some error, we always raise an ``HTTPError`` in our endpoint 
function if that error is to be returned to the client.

 **HTTPError Parameters**

 :status_code: 
  the HTTP Error code that corresponds to our error. The error codes supported 
  at present are below (more can be added as needed)
  ::

   400: 'Bad Request: Request could not be understood due to malformed syntax.'
   401: 'Unauthorized: Authentication was not provided or has failed.'
   404: 'Not Found: Requested resource is not available.'
   409: 'Conflict: Request could not be processed because of server conflict.'
   422: 'Unprocessable Entity: Request could not be processed due to semantic errors.'


 :description: 
  a string containing human readable information that a client user would find 
  informative, and rectify the issue. If we don't supply a description method, 
  the user will only read a generic message corresponding to the status code.

**Errors Handled by the Framework**

In some situations the framework or another module already handles these errors 
for us, so we do not need to worry about them. (The following list may not be 
exhaustive, feel free to add more)

 **Faulty Path Parameters:** If path parameters cannot be coerced to the type 
 specified by the route's rule parameter, it will send the client a response 
 with error information.

 **Validation Errors:** when we call the validate_form method from the validate 
 module, the validate module will always raise an HTTPError and supply 
 appropriate information.
